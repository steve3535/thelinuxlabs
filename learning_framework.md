## Trying to find out the learning framework that fits ... (September 2022)  

### 0. True learner attitude  
* be ready not to get it all within few days  
* have a plan and a timetable to support it  
* find time to focus  
* resist going to keyboard and start implementing  
* try as much as possible following teaching examples  
* resist multiplying sources of teaching on the same subjects for enlightment on specific topic  
* code everyday  

### 1. Have one or two very important projects in mind  
* its an incentive  
* keep the excitement of learning in order to realize the project  
* can be done iteratively as you are progressing and mastering your course  
* can be started with non technical (e.g. design or business model)  

### 2. Time is needed to learn well
* Dont rush learning, take time, especially for fundamentals  
* find strategies and ways to have a lot of time free for learning (one way to do that is to automate your tasks at work)  

### 2. Defining new foundations, new fundamentals:  
1. AWS (because it reinvents even businesses, ie money earning,its a rethink , its the new world)  
1. Python (for code, code as number 1 as well because its a language just like english we need to speak)
2. Bubble/Retool, my solution to my ignorance in frontend - needed to keep the project moving and to get fast to market ...
3. Design, to connect the dots
4. algo to dive deep ....
5. the new tools: k8s, terraform
6. Linux internals 
6. Linux troubleshooting
