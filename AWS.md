### EBS
* bound to AZ  
  * workwround this is to make snapshot and move it across  
* if not root volume, it is not set to delete upon termination by default  
* EBS = network drive --> can be attached/detached any how , --> there might be some latency when accessing the drive  
* can only be mounted at one instance at at time (CCP level)
